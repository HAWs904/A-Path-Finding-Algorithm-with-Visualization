A* Path Finding Algorithm with Visualization.

Left click the desired starting location, your choice. 
  Starting location will be indicated by the Green square.
  
Left click the desired ending location, your choice.
  Ending location will be indicated by the Maroon square.
  
Press and hold your left click to set barriers inbetween the starting location and the ending location. 

If you made a mistake, don't worry, you can right-click to reset the square. Then feel free to continue placing the starting point, ending point, and/or barrier at your desirted location(s). 

To start the program, press space bar. 

The algorithim will then proceed to find the ending point through "brute force"-esque tactics. It will search the entire grid trying to connect the starting point to the ending point while searching every available space. The algorithim will recognize where you have set the barriers once you reach them and continue to try to search for a way around barrier. Once the algorithm has connected the starting point to the end point, it will highlight the most optimal route in a AQUA blue color. Once the program has finished running and you have the most optimal route highlighted, you can press 'R' on your keyboard to reset the prgram and start again. 
  
 I tested this program on 20, 25, 30, 50, 75, 80, and 100 grid size. It worked everytime. 
 
 
CONTROLS:
Left Click - place the starting point, ending point, and barrier parameters. 
Right Click - undo the starting point, ending point, and barrier parameters.
SPACE - start the program
R - reset the program to run it again.
